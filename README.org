#+TITLE:Tdback's Literate Configuration

Welcome home!

NOTE: /This repository is currently being re-written as literate configuration using org-mode and Emacs. For the original source files, look to the commit history./

Here's my configuration for Arch Linux. You'll find dotfiles for the basis of my operating system: alacritty, my terminal emulator; bspwm, my window manager (WM) and sxhkd, the X daemon for my WM's hotkeys; polybar (the bar at the top of my screen); rofi, my application launcher; Emacs, my text editor of choice, and a slew of shell functions, aliases, and more!

* Why a literate configuration?
