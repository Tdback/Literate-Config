* What is literate programming?

Literate programming was originally conceived by Donald Knuth, in an effort to achieve significantly better documentation for programs. Knuth created the *WEB* system, which would both /weave/ and /tangle/ a literate programming document, which was composed of both text and blocks of code, producing (for example) both a LaTeX document and Pascal program. If you would like to read additional information regarding the origin of literate programming, the original paper can be found [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf][here]].
