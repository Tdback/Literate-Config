** Setting the key-repetition speed

This command sets the keyboard auto-repeat rate to an increased speed. That way I can move around a little bit faster when using `hjkl':

#+begin_src bash

  xset r rate 350 40
  
#+end_src

** Starting the Emacs daemon

Since I constantly use Emacs across several workspaces in my day-to-day workflow, the Emacs daemon is a must have on startup. Using this quick bash conditional check, I can have the daemon automatically start up each time bspwm is started (or restarted manually).

NOTE: /This could be replaced with/ =pgrep -x emacs=, /but then the script would check for both the Emacs client *and* the Emacs daemon processes, which could lead to a `false positive' if bspwm was restarted and the Emacs client is running, but the daemon isn't./

#+begin_src bash 

  if [[ ! $(ps aux | grep -q "[e]macs --daemon") ]]; then
    emacs --daemon
  fi

#+end_src
